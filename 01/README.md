# My very first assignment

Welcome to py101 first assignment

![logo]

The aim is to practicing with git and basic python usage.

## Part 1 - Using git

You have to:

1. clone your repository locally
2. create a file called MyBio.md where you write a few lines about yourself.
3. add the file to your repository
4. commit your change
5. sync with the remote

## Part 2 - Simple operation with python

A minimal python program is provided to you. It's now reading 2 numbers from the terminal and then will print out them.

Try it: 

```bash
$ python firstprogram.py 3 5
```

Edit the file firstprogram.py and and to the output the result of some mathematical operation between those numbers. Your choice.

Remember to add, commit and push.

## Extra - Play with command line interface

A modified version of the script topwords.py is included in this repository. Now it's returning all the words (just the words) sorted by frequency.

From the [gutemberg project][gutemberg] website **choose** a book and **try to pipe** it directly to the top words program using `curl`.

Then pipe out the command and try to **find** the most frequent word of at exactly 9 characters in your book.

Hint. Look online how to use the `grep` command. Or if you feel adventurous look for *regular expressions* and the `egrep` commands.

Write your command to a file called command.sh, commit and push!
